TODO:

(1) Make wp.scala
(2) Make a function wp(GC, VCGen.Assertion) : VCGen.Assertion
  - make a trait Condition that's either Assertion or WriteClause(x, a, i, v)
  - make a function wp(GC, Condition) for heavy-lifting
      - make a new getFreshVar
      - make a new replace(VCGen.Assertion)
      - make a assumptionToCondition(GCAssume(a)) function since that's beefy
      - make a case for assume ^, havoc, seq, branch, and assertion
(3) Figure out when to use \forall and when to use \exists
